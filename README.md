## What is Ashray ? ü§î

It so happens that at times that when people want to donate to humanitarian causes, they often struggle to find the right place to put their money to use.
<br/>

It is often seen that people get scammed and their money is stolen where they were just trying to do good to other people, they were trying to extend their help. Again, it is seen that there are some Clubs or NGOs who do not get enough funds to work for humanitarian causes because of the lack of proper representation.
<br/>

With Ashray we aim at bringing all the various NGOs and donors under one single roof to ease the burden of going to find their appropriate donors and the appropriate communities to donate to. With the help of our search filters and ask platform, it becomes easier for the people to find their right community to serve.
